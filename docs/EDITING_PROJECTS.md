# Editing Projects in AI-Agent

## Overview

The `make edit` command allows you to modify existing project configurations without recreating the entire project. This is useful for:

- Refining prompts based on initial results
- Adjusting time constraints as requirements change
- Iterating on project direction
- Course-correcting mid-execution

## Usage

```bash
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
```

## Features

### 1. Auto-Stop Running Projects

If your project is currently running, `edit-project` will:
1. Detect the running process
2. Gracefully stop it
3. Proceed with editing
4. Optionally restart with new configuration

**No manual intervention needed!**

### 2. Flexible Prompt Editing Modes

Choose how you want to modify your prompt:

#### Mode 1: Rewrite Completely
- Paste an entirely new prompt
- Overwrites current `prompt.md`
- Best for: Major direction changes

```bash
Select (1-4): 1
Enter your new prompt (press Ctrl+D when done):
[paste your new prompt]
```

#### Mode 2: Edit in Place
- Opens `prompt.md` in your editor (nano, vim, emacs, etc.)
- Respects `$EDITOR` environment variable
- Best for: Refining existing prompts

```bash
Select (1-4): 2
Opening prompt.md in nano...
# [editor opens, you make changes, save and exit]
```

#### Mode 3: Keep Current Prompt
- Only change time constraint
- Prompt stays exactly as-is
- Best for: Time adjustments only

```bash
Select (1-4): 3
‚úÖ Keeping current prompt
```

### 3. Git Safety Checks

Before editing, the system checks for uncommitted changes:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: You have uncommitted changes in this project.

 M src/index.html
 M src/styles.css
?? src/js/script.js

Proceed with editing anyway? (y/N): 
```

**Two-step safety:**
1. **Gate 1**: Do you want to proceed with uncommitted changes?
2. **Gate 2**: Auto-commit those changes now?

**Options:**
- **y ‚Üí y**: Commit changes, then proceed
- **y ‚Üí n**: Proceed without committing (changes remain uncommitted)
- **n**: Cancel editing, handle git state manually

### 4. Time Constraint Updates

Change time constraints with validation:

```bash
‚è±Ô∏è  Change time constraint? (current: in 20 minute(s) of time)
Examples: 30m, 1h, 2h30m, indefinite
Enter new duration or press ENTER to keep current: 1h

‚úÖ Configuration updated
```

**What happens:**
- `.agent/time_management_instructions.md` is regenerated with new time
- `.agent/time_log.txt` is updated with new start time
- Project version is incremented
- System ready for restart

### 5. Version Tracking

Every edit increments the project version:

**`.agent/time_log.txt`:**
```
Project Start Time: 2025-10-06 22:31:00
Time Constraint: in 1 hour(s) of time
Project Version: 2
Last Edited: 2025-10-06 22:31:00
```

**`.agent/edit_history.log`:**
```
================================================================================
Edit Version: 2
Edit Date: 2025-10-06 22:31:00
Previous Time Constraint: in 20 minute(s) of time
New Time Constraint: in 1 hour(s) of time
Prompt Modified: Yes
Editor Mode: Edit in place
Notes: Project configuration updated
================================================================================
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail
- Track project evolution
- Debug configuration issues
- Document iteration process

### 6. Automatic File Updates

When you edit a project, the system automatically:

‚úÖ Regenerates `.agent/time_management_instructions.md` (if time set)
‚úÖ Updates `.agent/time_log.txt` with new version & start time
‚úÖ Logs edit to `.agent/edit_history.log`
‚úÖ Commits changes to git
‚úÖ Clears `.agent/last_iteration_start.txt` (fresh start)

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# Start with running project
make edit PROJECT_NAME=spherical-music

# Output:
üîß Editing project: spherical-music
==================================

## Use Cases

### Iterative Prompt Refinement

**Scenario:** AI isn't producing desired results

```bash
# Edit prompt to add more specific instructions
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# Mode: Edit in place
# Add: "Focus on performance optimization, use lazy loading"
# Restart with same time: press ENTER
```

### Time Extension

**Scenario:** Need more time to complete task

```bash
# Extend time constraint
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# Mode: Keep current prompt
# New time: 2h (was 1h)
# Restart immediately
```

### Complete Pivot

**Scenario:** Change project direction entirely

```bash
# Rewrite prompt completely
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# Mode: Rewrite completely
# New prompt: [paste completely different requirements]
# New time: indefinite
# Restart with new direction
```

### Quick Fixes

**Scenario:** Typo or small correction in prompt

```bash
# Quick edit in editor
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# Mode: Edit in place
# Fix typo: "React" ‚Üí "Vue"
# Keep same time: press ENTER
```

## Files Modified by Edit

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt.md                               # Modified by user
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .agent/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time_management_instructions.md    # Regenerated if time set
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ time_log.txt                       # Updated: version, start time
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edit_history.log                   # Appended: edit details
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ last_iteration_start.txt           # Cleared (if exists)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TODO.md                            # Preserved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                                  # New commit created
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [user files preserved]                 # No changes to your code
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Before Major Edits

```bash
# Manually commit work in progress
cd ../my-project
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Feature X partially implemented"

# Then edit
cd ../ai-agent
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
```

### 2. Check Edit History

```bash
# Review project evolution
cat ../my-project/.agent/edit_history.log

# See current version
cat ../my-project/.agent/time_log.txt
```

### 3. Test Prompt Changes

```bash
# Edit with short time for testing
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# New time: 10m (test run)

# If successful, edit again for full run
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# New time: 2h (production run)
```

### 4. Keep Indefinite for Exploration

```bash
# Remove time pressure for open-ended work
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# New time: indefinite
# Stop manually when satisfied
```

## Troubleshooting

### Editor Not Opening

**Problem:** `edit-project` says "opening nano" but nothing happens

**Solution:**
```bash
# Set your preferred editor
export EDITOR=vim  # or nano, emacs, code, etc.

# Or set permanently in ~/.bashrc
echo 'export EDITOR=vim' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Can't Find Project

**Problem:** `Project 'my-project' not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# List available projects
ls ../ | grep -v ai-agent

# Use exact project name
make edit PROJECT_NAME=exact-name-here
```

### Time Constraint Not Applied

**Problem:** Project runs indefinitely despite setting time

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify time management file exists
ls -la ../my-project/.agent/time_management_instructions.md

# Check time_log.txt
cat ../my-project/.agent/time_log.txt

# If files missing, edit again:
make edit PROJECT_NAME=my-project
# Set time constraint properly
```

### Git Conflicts After Edit

**Problem:** Git complains about conflicts

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ../my-project
git status

# Resolve conflicts manually
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts after edit"

# Continue with agent
cd ../ai-agent
make run PROJECT_NAME=my-project
```

## Comparison: Edit vs Recreate

| Aspect | Edit Project | Recreate Project |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Preserves code | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (must backup) |
| Preserves git history | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Starts fresh |
| Version tracking | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Always v1 |
| Speed | ‚úÖ Fast | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower |
| Complexity | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚úÖ Simple |
| When to use | Refinement | Complete restart |
