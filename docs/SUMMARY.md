# AI-Agent: Complete Documentation Summary

## Overview
This repository provides a complete implementation of the AI agent loop technique using Qwen. The AI agent loop technique involves running a coding agent in an infinite loop to continuously work on codebases for tasks like porting, maintenance, feature implementation, and bug fixing.

- `examples/react-to-vue/`: React to Vue conversion example

## Getting Started

1. Install Qwen CLI: `npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest`
2. Clone this repository
3. Use `make create` for the enhanced workflow to create a new project
4. Customize `prompt.md` with your specific instructions
5. Run `make run PROJECT_NAME=name` to start the AI agent loop

## Key Concepts

The AI agent loop technique works best with:
- Simple, clear prompts (less is more)
- Well-defined tasks (porting, conversion, maintenance)
- Proper Git workflow and version control
- Regular monitoring and intervention when needed
- Understanding that the agent will make mistakes that require human correction
- **Proper file system tool configuration** (essential for file operations)

## Use Cases

- Codebase porting (React to Vue, Python to TypeScript, etc.)
- Repository maintenance and updates
- Feature implementation across large codebases
- Bug fixes and refactoring
- API implementation from specifications

## Best Practices

- Start with simple prompts and small codebases
- Monitor progress regularly
- Use Git properly with frequent commits
- Plan for imperfection - the technique is "deterministically bad in an undeterministic world"
- Set up proper monitoring and logging
- Have backup strategies for long-running processes
- **Ensure proper tool configuration for file system access** (critical for success)
